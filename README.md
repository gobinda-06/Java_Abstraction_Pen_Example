# Java_Abstraction_Pen_Example
This project demonstrates the concept of abstraction and runtime polymorphism in Java using an abstract class Pen. The program defines abstract methods write() and refill(), which are implemented in a subclass to show how abstract classes enforce method implementation while enabling dynamic dispatch.
